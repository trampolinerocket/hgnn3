Python code for Hacker's guide to Neural Networks - Andrej Karpathy blog - https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/

The original example code is written in Javascript so here we are trying to create a python verstion of the example code without changing any variable or function names so that the same explanation will be valid for the python examples too.
